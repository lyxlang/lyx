## Examples

#### Summation

```lyx
def sum lst =
  match lst {
    [] -> 0;
    [hd, tl...] -> hd + sum tl;
  }
```

#### Fibonacci

```lyx
def fib n : Int -> Int =
  if n <= 1 then n else fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
```

#### Grammar

For a detailed presentation of the Lyx syntax and features, please have a look at [our sample grammar file](https://github.com/lyxlang/lyx/blob/main/examples/grammar.lyx).

You can also take a look at a more fleshed out program like [our implementation of Conway’s Game of Life](https://github.com/lyxlang/lyx/blob/main/examples/conway.lyx).

## Usage

You can skip installation when [running from source](https://github.com/lyxlang/lyx/wiki/Running-from-source).

The expected file extension of the Lyx programming language is `.lyx`.

Following [docopt](http://docopt.org/) conventions:

| Command                | Description                                       |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `lyx`                  | Parse standard input and display the AST.         |
| `lyx <file>`           | Parse a file and display the AST.                 |
| `lyx fmt`              | Format standard input and output it.              |
| `lyx fmt <file>`       | Format a file and overwrite it.                   |
| `lyx transpile`        | Transpile standard input and output it.           |
| `lyx transpile <file>` | Transpile a file and write its OCaml counterpart. |

You can run transpiled files using:

```sh
ocaml <file.ml>
```

## Installation

If you are using [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), please follow [these steps](https://github.com/lyxlang/lyx/wiki/Installation-on-NixOS).

Or, download [the latest executable](https://github.com/lyxlang/lyx/releases/latest) for your system and [add it to your PATH](https://github.com/lyxlang/lyx/wiki/Adding-Lyx-to-the-PATH).

On Unix-like operating systems, you will then need to run the following command:

```sh
chmod +x /path/to/lyx/executable
```
